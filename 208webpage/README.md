# Overview
This project was a great project to learn how a website interacts with the back end that I created as well as being able to better understand http://requests and other nuances such as you state and understanding how react works with user data being inputted into a form field.

This website is basically trying to be the replacement for Facebook marketplace it allows users to post anything and everything they want without having the fear of that data being used and our malicious way or being able to post certain things like houses cars or other items that Facebook doesn't deem safe but are totally legal within the United States and legal in the state of Idaho.

The reason I made this website is because I felt Facebook marketplace had some things that were going on that I didn't really appreciate or restrictions as well as trying to find alternative websites it was really frustrating from not a really good UI or not a very good implementation of the website itself so it made it difficult to find items for sale that you were interested in

# Web Pages

I create a home page which holds all the posts so that you can view them directly from the front of the website

I created a profile page so that way you can see your user username as well as the e-mail and eventually in the future be able to edit and delete and find posts in that user profile page.

Lastly I created a login and register page that basically just allows the user to log in & up for the website and be able to have that login information


# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio code as my text editor as well as being able to run my programs and I used a couple of plugins for react

* React
* ES7

for the language I used I used react I don't know how much I like the language I'm still struggling with certain concepts understanding how to use cut hooks as well as the way the development works is a little difficult but it does have a lot of library support which is awesome one such library that I used was react Dom router and react bootstrap those were great libraries that helped me out.

* React Dom router allows you to route and update the virtual Dom
* react bootstrap allowed you to do a bunch of pre built CSS so you didn't have to configure everything.
* Axios is a library that allows us to do http://requests it simplifies the process as well as enables us to use built in features to allow us to get Jason data and headers and split them up
